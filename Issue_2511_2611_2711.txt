Issues 2511_2611_2711
-----------------------------------------
1. Read paper `AI for low-code for AI`

- in its related paper: 

1.1 Expectation vs. Experience: Evaluating the Usability of Code
Generation Tools Powered by Large Language Models
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519665

- mentioned the generated code by llm model is hard to understand for users 
- also decomposition of complex task help improve the performance of llm

- highlight different parts of code and generate test case help user understand and debug the code

1.2 CodeGen: An Open Large Language Model for Code with Multi-Turn Program Synthesis

- 2022, llm model for program synthesis 
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13474


1.4 Pipeline Combinators for Gradual AutoML

https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/a3b36cb25e2e0b93b5f334ffb4e4064e-Paper.pdf

- github slides and code: https://github.com/IBM/lale/blob/master/talks/2019-1105-lale.pdf

- or Gradual AutoML using Lale https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3534678.3542630
- introduce `Lale` 
,  a sklearn-compatible library that offers compositional automated machine learning for data scientist and the **ml pipeline can be visualized as graphical pipeline**: 

- we'll write the rest papers in the git issues 
https://github.com/xp1632/Aalen_working_log/issues/5

Main task today:







----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

1. to repair the meniscus

- we need to first do MRI to check how bad it is broken
- then do arthroscopy in knee

- the doctor in Aalen can do MRI but cannot do operation 
	- we find two doctor that can do knee operation in Stuttgart
	
	- 1. DEC .17: Mr. Priv.-Doz. Dr. med. habil. Ulf Schlegel https://www.doctolib.de/orthopadie/stuttgart/ulf-schlegel?insurance_sector=public&pid=practice-262479#presentation
	(close to direct hbf but not 100% sure about insurance type)
	
	- 2. DEC.3 Dr. med. Steffen Odenwald
	https://www.doctolib.de/orthopadie/stuttgart/steffen-odenwald?insurance_sector=public&pid=practice-217965
	(sure about insurance type but a little walk required)

### Team meeting

- we have a team meeting today

- Tim

	1. Joint Proposal with Kaiserslautern persons
		- topic about measuring quality of sythetic generated data
		- in a task-indenpendent, meta way
	
	2. Abstract about coupling simulation for a short-notice conference, main content is based on previous CVPR paper
		

- Miriam
	
	1. Joint Discussion about the `synthetic traing data` topic in 2 weeks
		- data collection from a master thesis is done
		- further work required

- Ziwei 
	
	- Last week: Literature research in llm and vp:
	- work summary: 
	
		- viperGPT: 
		- Lowcoder: 
	
	- Next: 
		- Figure out the language model part used by LowCoder	
		- Deploy cluster settings and test-run ViperGPT involved models
