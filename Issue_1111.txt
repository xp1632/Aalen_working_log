1. What is evolutionary image processing?

Evolutionary optimization of image processing for cell detection in
microscopy images 

-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

1. evolutionary image processing

2. Continue llm course

3. Samuel's seminar

- 【explainable AI】 ： 

- disadvantages of NN: 

   - why decision is made during NN,
   - also requries a lot of training data
----

- [differentiable image processing]
	- gradients based optimization

### gist: 

- the node in our case is the image operation 
- we push paramater of the operation instead of weights of node
- try to find a benchmark : input image <--what's the  original program--> output image 

- this is for image registration and reverse [let the system to repair the damage of the image] 

- we need an env, dark --> light; noise ---> unnoise
- list of operation

[samuel's task] :

- prepare a image problem dataset that: 

problem types: classification, single object detection, multi object detection, image registration, 


trainng_data/test_data:

**x** --> image_that is too dark
**y** --> image_that is lightened and not too dark now
**cost function** to compare if the images are identical for different type of problem: L2 norm, PSNR,SSIM,

---
- possible problems:

- brightness/contrast/hue/saturation
- to
- image 

- image category: 
- find industry-image problems

[manuela's task]

- take care of the model part 
- GUI of dashboard
- input image <--model find out what's the program in the process as genetic operations--> output image

- evolutionary image processing

Take away:

- While EAs works slow but (accurate?)
- And
